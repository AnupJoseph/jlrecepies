Never Resting. A dream of Spring. Fire and blood. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. A dream of Spring. Words are like wind. A dream of Spring. You know nothing, Jon Snow. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. The Knight of Lemonwood. And now his watch is ended. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The rains of castamere. The battle of the redgrass field. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. Can a man still be brave if he's afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters =>.
