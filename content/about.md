# Hi there

My name is Anup and I'm the primary author of this site. These are a bag to tricks that I use very often in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming. Most of these tricks are centered about common data science stuff that I reuse every now and then and forget more often.

If you want to add more techniques to this repo, please feel free to submit a pull request.
(P.S. If that sounds too intimidating, just send the idea you want to add and I'll add it under your preferred name.)
